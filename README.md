## My process

This was my first Frontend challenge so tried to complete without looking for a soloution first. Took the advice from the Frontend README and started at the top and worked my way down. Struggled at some bits, in particular positioning.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I used this project to learn more about position attribute, as this is what is was struggling on at the time; and i thnk i now have a better understanding of it, in particular positon : relative and positon :absolute parent/child.

I also used this as an opportunity learn about linking VS-code to Github.
